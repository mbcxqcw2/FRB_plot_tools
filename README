Various interactive plotting tools for use when single pulse searching filterbank data.

Current tools:

FRBplot.py

Plots part of a sigproc filterbank file.
Subplots include dynamic spectra (dispersed and dedispersed) and associated bandpasses, and a dedispersed timeseries.

Requirements:

-astropy
-sigpyproc: https://github.com/ewanbarr/sigpyproc
-numpy
-matplotlib

Usage:

python FRBplot.py [File] [Time] [DM] [Downsamp factor]

[File]            : Full path to and name of filterbank file to plot
[Time]            : Time of pulse into file (seconds)
[DM]              : DM of pulse (pc/cc)
[Downsamp factor] : Width of pulse/boxcar filter to convolve data with (integer number of bins)

Example output:

./FRBplot_example.png

FRBcands.py

Plots the results of a single pulse search of a filterbank file in the style of PRESTO's single_pulse_search.py.
Subplots include DM vs Time, DM vs S/N, and DM, S/N histograms.
Currently supports candidate files generated by: PRESTO, seek, DESTROY and dedisperse_all.

Requirements:

-numpy
-matplotlib
-os
-sigpyproc: https://github.com/ewanbarr/sigpyproc
-sys

Usage:

python FRBcands.py [Search algorithm] [Fil file loc] [Low DM] [High DM] [Min time] [Max time] [S/N threshold] [Cand file loc]

[Search algorithm] : Identifier for single pulse search algorithm used to generate candidate files which will be plotted.
                     Currently may be one of [presto, seek, destroy, dedisperse_all]
[Fil file loc]     : Full path to and name of filterbank file used to generate candidate files.
[Low DM]           : Plot candidates with DMs above this value (pc/cc)
[High DM]          : Plot candidates with DMs below this value (pc/cc)
[Min time]         : Plot candidates occurring after this time in file (seconds)
[Max time]         : Plot candidates occurring before this time in file (seconds)
[S/N threshold]    : Plot candidates above this S/N threshold
[Cand file loc]    : Full path to directory containing candidate files to plot.

Note: Output candidate files generated by PRESTO have a '.singlepulse' file extension
Note: Output candidate files generated by DESTROY have a '.pls' file extension
Note: Output candidate files generated by SEEK have a '.pls' file extension by default. These must be renamed with a '.s' file extension
      to avoid confusion with DESTROY output.
Note: Output candidate files generated by DEDISPERSE_ALL must be given the file extension '.dd'.

Example output:

./FRBcand_example.png
